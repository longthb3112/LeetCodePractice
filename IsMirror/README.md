# Description
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

# Example 1:
Input:
```
this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3

```
Output:
```
true
 
 ```

# Example 2:
Input:
```
[1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3

```
Output:
```
 false
 
```
