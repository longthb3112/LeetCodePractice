# Description
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

# Example 1:
Input:
```
Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

```
Output:
```
 true
 
 ```

# Example 2:
Input:
```
Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:

       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4

```
Output:
```
false
